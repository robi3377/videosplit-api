    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 18, 2026</p>

    <p>VideoSplit ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what personal information we collect, how we use it, with whom we share it, and the choices you have. By using VideoSplit, you agree to the collection and use of your information as described here.</p>
    <p>Questions? Contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@videosplit.com">privacy@videosplit.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Account Information.</strong> When you register, we collect your name, email address, and (if applicable) an encrypted password. If you sign in via Google, we receive your Google account identifier, name, and profile picture.</p>
    <p><strong>Video Content.</strong> Files you upload are stored temporarily — for processing and up to 24 hours afterward — then permanently deleted. We do not analyze video content beyond what is required to perform the splitting operation.</p>
    <p><strong>Usage and Log Data.</strong> We automatically collect API request logs (endpoint, timestamp, status, duration), minutes processed, rate-limit events, and error logs for stability monitoring.</p>
    <p><strong>Device and Network Information.</strong> We collect your IP address, browser type, operating system, and referring URL. We derive general geographic location (country/region) from your IP address for security and analytics purposes.</p>
    <p><strong>Billing Information.</strong> Payment card details are collected and stored exclusively by Stripe. We do not store full card numbers. We receive and store transaction identifiers, subscription status, and billing history from Stripe.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account management:</strong> To create and maintain your account, authenticate you, and provide access to the Service.</li>
        <li><strong>Service delivery:</strong> To receive, process, split, and temporarily store video files and make results available to you.</li>
        <li><strong>Billing:</strong> To initiate subscription charges through Stripe, manage your plan, and provide billing history.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage tracking:</strong> To measure monthly consumption against your plan limits and enforce rate limits.</li>
        <li><strong>Communications:</strong> To send transactional emails (account confirmations, password resets, billing receipts, service announcements). We do not send marketing emails without your explicit opt-in.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics and improvement:</strong> To understand how users interact with the Service and improve performance and features, using aggregated and anonymized data wherever possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> To detect, investigate, and prevent fraudulent activity, abuse, and unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal compliance:</strong> To comply with applicable laws, respond to lawful requests, and enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Uploaded and processed video files</strong> are permanently deleted within 24 hours of processing completion. You are responsible for downloading your segments within this window.</li>
        <li><strong>Account data</strong> (name, email, plan info) is retained while your account is active. Upon deletion, personal data is removed or anonymized within 30 days, except where retention is legally required (e.g., billing records for up to 7 years).</li>
        <li><strong>Usage logs</strong> are retained for up to 12 months, then deleted or anonymized.</li>
        <li><strong>Anonymized analytics data</strong> may be retained indefinitely as it cannot be linked to individuals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We share data with third parties only as follows:</p>
    <p><strong>Stripe (Payment Processing).</strong> Your payment details are processed under Stripe's privacy policy (<a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stripe.com/privacy</a>). We share your email and subscription data with Stripe solely to manage your billing relationship.</p>
    <p><strong>Google (Authentication).</strong> If you sign in with Google, your authentication is handled by Google's OAuth 2.0 service. Google shares your name, email, and profile picture with us upon your authorization. See <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's privacy policy</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Infrastructure Providers.</strong> We use cloud hosting providers to run our servers. These providers act as data processors under our instruction and are contractually prohibited from using your data for their own purposes.</p>
    <p><strong>Legal Requirements.</strong> We may disclose your information if required by law, to protect the rights or safety of VideoSplit or its users, or to respond to a valid government request.</p>
    <p><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> In the event of a merger or acquisition, your data may transfer to a successor entity. We will notify you before your data becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>5. Cookies</h2>
    <p>We use a minimal approach to cookies. We set session cookies to maintain your authenticated state (deleted when you log out or close your browser), and may set functional cookies to remember preferences such as dark mode. We do not use advertising cookies, third-party tracking cookies, or behavioral profiling technologies. You can disable cookies in your browser settings, but doing so will prevent you from staying logged in.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> View your account information in your dashboard, or request a full data export at <a href="mailto:privacy@videosplit.com">privacy@videosplit.com</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Correction:</strong> Update your name and email in account settings at any time.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Delete your account from account settings. Personal data is removed within 30 days, subject to legal retention requirements. Video files are deleted within 24 hours regardless.</li>
        <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Request a machine-readable copy of your account data by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@videosplit.com">privacy@videosplit.com</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Objection:</strong> Where we process your data based on legitimate interests, you may object by contacting us. We will honor your objection unless we have compelling grounds to continue.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We respond to all data rights requests within 30 days and may need to verify your identity first.</p>

    <h2>7. GDPR — EU and EEA Users</h2>
    <p>If you are in the EU, EEA, or UK, you have additional rights under the GDPR:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Legal basis for processing:</strong> We process your data on the basis of (a) contractual necessity (to provide the Service), (b) your consent (for optional communications), (c) legal obligations, and (d) legitimate interests (security, fraud prevention, analytics).</li>
        <li><strong>Right to restrict processing:</strong> You may request we restrict processing while a dispute about accuracy or lawfulness is pending.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to complain:</strong> You may lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.</li>
        <li><strong>International transfers:</strong> Your data is processed on servers in the United States. Transfers from the EU/EEA are covered by standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard technical and organizational measures to protect your information, including TLS/HTTPS encryption for all data in transit, encryption of sensitive data at rest, and access controls limiting data access to authorized personnel. No method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security but will notify you promptly in the event of a breach affecting your data.</p>

    <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The Service is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@videosplit.com">privacy@videosplit.com</a> and we will delete it promptly.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the "Last updated" date and notify active users via email at least 14 days before material changes take effect. Your continued use of the Service constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
