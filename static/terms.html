    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 18, 2026</p>

    <p>Welcome to VideoSplit. By accessing or using our service, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. Please read them carefully before using VideoSplit.</p>

    <h2>1. Service Description</h2>
    <p>VideoSplit ("the Service") provides an online platform for splitting video files into equal-duration segments. The Service is operated by VideoSplit and is available via our website and API. Features vary by subscription plan.</p>

    <h2>2. Account Registration</h2>
    <p>To use VideoSplit, you must create an account. By registering, you agree that:</p>
    <ul>

        <li>You will provide accurate, current, and complete registration information.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials.</li>
        <li>You will notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.</li>
        <li>You are solely responsible for all activity that occurs under your account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Usage Limits and Quotas</h2>
    <p>Each subscription plan includes specific usage limits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Free:</strong> 100 minutes of video processed per month, 5 API requests per minute.</li>
        <li><strong>Starter ($19/mo):</strong> 1,000 minutes per month, 20 API requests per minute.</li>

        <li><strong>Enterprise:</strong> Unlimited minutes, 200 API requests per minute, dedicated support.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Exceeding your quota will result in requests being rejected until the next billing cycle. VideoSplit reserves the right to adjust plan limits with 30 days notice.</p>

    <h2>4. Payment Terms and Refunds</h2>
    <p>Paid plans are billed monthly. Payments are processed by Stripe. By subscribing, you authorize recurring charges to your payment method. Subscriptions auto-renew unless cancelled before the renewal date.</p>
    <p>Refunds are governed by our <a href="/static/refund-policy.html">Refund Policy</a>. In general, a 7-day money-back guarantee applies to new subscriptions. After this period, payments are non-refundable.</p>

    <h2>5. Prohibited Uses</h2>
    <p>You may not use VideoSplit to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Upload, process, or distribute content that is illegal, harmful, abusive, defamatory, obscene, or infringes any third-party rights.</li>
        <li>Upload videos containing malware, viruses, or other harmful code.</li>
        <li>Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or extract the source code of the Service.</li>
        <li>Resell, sublicense, or commercialize the Service without explicit written permission.</li>
        <li>Perform automated abuse, scraping, or denial-of-service attacks against the Service.</li>
        <li>Circumvent rate limits, quotas, or access controls.</li>
        <li>Use the Service for any purpose that violates applicable local, national, or international law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Uploaded video files and processed segments are automatically deleted from our servers <strong>24 hours after processing</strong>. You are responsible for downloading your segments before they expire. We do not take responsibility for data lost due to expiration.</p>
    <p>Account data (email, usage logs, billing history) is retained while your account is active. You may request deletion of your account and associated data by contacting <a href="mailto:privacy@videosplit.com">privacy@videosplit.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>You retain full ownership of all video content you upload and process through VideoSplit. By using the Service, you grant VideoSplit a limited, non-exclusive license to process your content solely for the purpose of providing the Service.</p>
    <p>VideoSplit's software, branding, documentation, and all other original content are the intellectual property of VideoSplit and may not be copied or redistributed without permission.</p>

    <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do not guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or that results will be accurate or complete.</p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, VideoSplit shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Service, including loss of data, loss of revenue, or loss of business, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. Our total liability shall not exceed the amount you paid to us in the 12 months preceding the claim.</p>

    <h2>10. Termination</h2>
    <p>VideoSplit reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account at any time, with or without notice, for violation of these Terms or for any other reason at our sole discretion. Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. Provisions that by their nature should survive termination will do so.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms at any time. We will notify registered users by email or via a notice on the Service at least 14 days before changes take effect. Continued use of the Service after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

    <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the United States. Any disputes shall be resolved in the applicable courts of the United States, and you consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.</p>
