    <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 18, 2026</p>

    <p>At VideoSplit, we want you to feel confident choosing a paid plan. This Refund Policy explains when and how refunds are issued, how to request one, and what happens when you cancel your subscription. This policy is incorporated by reference into our <a href="/static/terms.html">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> New paid subscribers receive a 7-day money-back guarantee on their first charge. After 7 days, subscription payments are non-refundable. You may cancel at any time to stop future charges.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. Seven-Day Money-Back Guarantee</h2>
    <p>We offer a full refund on your first subscription charge if you are unsatisfied for any reason, provided you meet both of the following conditions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>New subscription only:</strong> The guarantee applies to the very first charge on a new paid subscription. If you have previously held a paid plan or re-subscribed after cancelling, it applies only to the first charge of your newest subscription.</li>
        <li><strong>Within 7 days:</strong> Your refund request must be submitted within 7 calendar days of the date the charge was made.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If your request is eligible, we will issue a full refund of the charge — no fees deducted, no explanation required (though feedback is always welcome).</p>

    <h2>2. How to Request a Refund</h2>
    <p>Send an email to <a href="mailto:billing@videosplit.com">billing@videosplit.com</a> with the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Subject line:</strong> <code>Refund Request</code></li>
        <li>The email address linked to your VideoSplit account.</li>
        <li>The date and amount of the charge you are requesting a refund for (found in your billing confirmation email or account billing history).</li>
        <li>A brief description of the issue (optional, but appreciated).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please send your request from the email address associated with your account so we can verify ownership. We aim to acknowledge all requests within one business day.</p>

    <h2>3. Processing Time</h2>
    <p>Once approved, we will initiate the refund through Stripe. Allow <strong>5 to 10 business days</strong> for the credit to appear on your original payment method — processing times vary by bank. You will receive a confirmation email when the refund is initiated. Refunds are returned to the original payment method only; we cannot issue refunds to a different card or account.</p>

    <h2>4. What Is Not Refundable</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Charges older than 7 days</strong> are not eligible for a refund.</li>
        <li><strong>Monthly renewal charges</strong> — the 7-day guarantee applies only to the first charge of a new subscription, not to recurring renewals.</li>
        <li><strong>Plan upgrades</strong> — prorated charges for mid-cycle plan upgrades are non-refundable.</li>
        <li><strong>Partial months after cancellation</strong> — upon cancellation, you retain paid access until the end of your billing period, but unused days are not refunded (unless within the 7-day window on your most recent charge).</li>
        <li><strong>Accounts terminated for Terms of Service violations</strong> — no refund will be issued if your account was suspended or terminated for violating our Terms.</li>
        <li><strong>Free plan</strong> — no charges apply, so this policy does not apply.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Cancellation</h2>
    <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time through the billing portal in your account:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Log in → <strong>Dashboard → Billing → Manage Billing</strong></li>
        <li>In the Stripe billing portal, select <strong>Cancel Subscription</strong> and confirm.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period. You will not be charged again after confirmation, and you retain paid plan access until the period end date. After that, your account reverts to the FREE plan.</p>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Cancellation alone does not trigger a refund. If you cancel within 7 days of your first charge and want a refund, you must also submit a refund request as described in Section 2.</p>
    <p>If you cannot access the billing portal, contact <a href="mailto:billing@videosplit.com">billing@videosplit.com</a> and we will cancel it for you.</p>

    <h2>6. Billing Errors</h2>
    <p>Regardless of the 7-day window, we will always correct verified billing errors, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Duplicate charges for the same billing period.</li>
        <li>Charges processed after a confirmed cancellation.</li>
        <li>Charges for the wrong plan tier due to a system error on our part.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you believe you were charged in error, contact <a href="mailto:billing@videosplit.com">billing@videosplit.com</a> and we will investigate promptly.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Refund Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated date. Material changes will be communicated to active subscribers via email. For charges that occurred before a policy change, the version of the policy in effect at the time of the charge will apply.</p>
